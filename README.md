Object Extrusion 3D
===================

An application which creates 3D objects by rotating, moving and scalling 2D objects in space.  
Multiple transformations can be added to a storyboard and their effect viewed using animation.  

The created models and the associated transformations can be saved to a file and loaded later.  
It includes support for creating models using BÃ©zier curves and editing of the control points.

Project done for the "Computer Graphics" course.  
Written in C++ using OpenGL and GLUI for the GUI.  

The following two videos demonstrate how the objects are drawn:
